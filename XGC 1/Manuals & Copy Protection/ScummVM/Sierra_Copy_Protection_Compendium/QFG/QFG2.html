<h2>Where the Heck Am I?</h2>

The streets of the city of Shapier can be *extremely* confusing to navigate. Fortunately, there's an autonav map available from the very beginning of the game...but unfortunately, you'll have to make it to the money changer's office and back before you can buy it.
<p>
Click <a href="QFG2.png">here</a> to see the street layouts of the city. You can use this map to manually navigate until you get the in-game map.
