<h2>The (Il)Logic Cliffs</h2>
<p>
Getting to the top of the Isle of the Sacred Mountain requires you to climb the Logic Cliffs, a series of puzzles that double as CP checks. Much of the information needed to solve the riddles of the cliff is found in wonderfully-cryptic clues contained in the game manual (which are reproduced below).
<p>
The first challenge: <i>Only those pure of heart will be able to RISE the cliffs of logic.</i>
<p>
The second challenge: <i>A master of languages will soar.</i>
<p>
The third challenge:<br>
<i>Four men standing in a row,<br>
Third from the left, and down you go.<br>
The rest, in order, move you on,<br>
The Youngest, the Oldest, and the Second Son.</i>
<p>
The fourth challenge: <i>The Sacred Four of the Ancient One's philosophy were the emotion 'tranquility', the color 'azure', the creature 'caterpillar', and the element 'air'.</i>
<p>
The fifth challenge: <i>Only those of the highest order may ASCEND the cliffs of logic.</i>
<p>
In addition to the above riddles, you will need to be able to decipher the ancient alphabet of the Sacred Ones, found <a href="KQ6-A.PNG">here</a>.
<p>
Oh, and try not to fall off, hmm?
<p>
<h2>Watch Your Step</h2>
<p>
Inside the catacombs on the Isle of the Sacred Mountain are a number of deadly traps (where's Indy when you need him?). The first of these requires you to navigate a floor of booby-trapped tiles. To cross safely, you must step on the tiles in a certain order; get it wrong, and you're toast.
<p>
The information needed to decipher the tiles originally took the form of a poem in the KQ6 manual:
<p>
<i>Three roses laid upon the bower,<br>
A scythe for he who cuts the flower,<br>
A crown, a dove, most noble race!<br>
Thy bones make sacred this dread place.</i>
<p>
