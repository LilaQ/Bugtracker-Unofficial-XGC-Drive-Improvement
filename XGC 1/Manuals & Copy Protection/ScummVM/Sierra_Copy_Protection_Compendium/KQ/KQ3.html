<h2>Spelling Errors</h2>
<p>
The core gimmick of King's Quest 3 is, of course, the magic spells that Gwydion must create to complete his quest. The instructions for creating these spells, which originally appeared in the KQ3 documentation, are <a href="KQ3.txt">here</a>.
<p>
To begin casting a spell, approach Mannannan's spell book (you <b>did</b> find it, right?) and type "TURN TO PAGE #", where # is the <b>roman numeral</b> of the page for the spell you wish to work on.
<p>
WARNING: As any King's Quest fan will tell you, the KQ3 spellcasting system is by far the single most <b>unforgiving</b> CP scheme ever devised. You must have ALL the ingredients and tools needed before you begin (you can't leave mid-spell), and you must follow the directions EXACTLY. Even a single erronious word will result in your immediate (though quite funny) demise. SAVE BEFORE ATTEMPTING.
