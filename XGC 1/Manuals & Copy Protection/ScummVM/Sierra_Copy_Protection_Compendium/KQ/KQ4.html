<h2>Words of Power</h2>
<p>
When you first start the game, you'll be asked to look up a certain word in your manual and enter it to continue. <a href="KQ4.txt">Here</a> is a list of (almost) all of the words the program might ask for, copied straight out of my King's Quest Collection manual. Look up the proper section, page number, paragraph, and word, and enter it to begin the game.
<p>
NOTE: I have discovered that the above list is <b>incomplete</b>...there have been a handful of instances where the game asked me for words not listed here. Still, there are enough answers here that you should be able to reload the game and get one that <b>is</b> listed on your next attempt.
