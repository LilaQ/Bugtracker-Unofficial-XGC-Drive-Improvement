<h2>Little Black Book</h2>
<p>
When you first start LSL2, you will be shown a photograph of a woman from Larry's "little black book", part of the original LSL2 documentation. Find the picture <a href="LSL2.PNG">here</a>, then enter the corresponding phone number to gain access to the game itself.
<p>
There is also an alternate means of passing this CP check. When prompted, enter the number <b>555-0724</b>. This number (July 24th, Al Lowe's birthday) will be accepted, regardless of which picture is displayed. <b>However</b>...this trick <b>only</b> works on certain later versions of LSL2 (typically, the version(s) from the LSL collections)...it will not work on early release versions.
<p>
Additionally, using the special phone number will skip the game's introductory sequence entirely. If you wish to see it, you must pass the CP check by normal means.
