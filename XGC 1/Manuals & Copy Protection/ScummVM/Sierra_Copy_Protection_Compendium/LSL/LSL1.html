<h2>The "Age Check" Quiz</h2>
<p>
To play the game, you must enter your age as being between 16 and 99 (that is, anything but the 'under 15' or 'over 100' choices) to proceed, and must then "prove" your age by answering trivia questions. At any time during the quiz, press CONTROL+ALT+X to bypass the questions and skip straight to the game.
<p>
This same trick will also work in the original, EGA version of LSL1. However, you must enter your age as being over <b>18</b> in that game.
<p>

<h2>The 'Special' Question</h2>
<p>
After you have answered/skipped the age test questions, you will be asked one question about the extra materials in the game package. This is copy protection, and cannot be skipped with the CONTROL+ALT+X trick. Click <a href="LSL1.txt">here</a> to find the correct answers to these questions.
