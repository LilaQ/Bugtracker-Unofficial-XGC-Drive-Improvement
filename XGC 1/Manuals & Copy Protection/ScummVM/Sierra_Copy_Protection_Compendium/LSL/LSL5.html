<h2>Fly the Proud Dork</h2>
<p>
Larry's part of the game requires him to travel to various East Coast destinations via AeroDork Airlines. To board the planes, you must obtain a boarding pass from the machine outside the airport terminal.
<p>
When you activate the machine, you'll be shown a list of possible destinations, each of which has a departure time listed. Make note of the destination you want AND the time listed next to it, look it up <a href="LSL5.png">here</a>, then click the selection you want and enter the proper code to obtain your boarding pass.

<h2>Password Recovery</h2>
<p>
LSL5 is the first (and only) Larry game to include a built-in parental lockout mechanism; by specifying a password at the opening screen, the player can effectively prevent other users from playing the game.
<p>
If for whatever reason you forget your password, or if the game somehow gets set up with one you didn't specify, you can manually remove it from the command prompt. Simply go into your LSL5 directory and delete the MEMORY.DRV file, which is really the stored password. Deleting this file will restore LSL5 to the default unprotected mode.
