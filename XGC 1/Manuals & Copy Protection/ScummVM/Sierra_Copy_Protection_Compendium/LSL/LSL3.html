<h2>The "Age Check" Quiz, Again</h2>
<p>
To play the game, you must enter your age as being at least 13 to to proceed. If you select the '13 to 17' option, you will be able to play the game, but will be restricted to the lowest 'Filth' level. To access the higher 'Filth' levels, you must enter your age as being at least 18, and must then "prove" your age by answering trivia questions. For every question you get wrong, the game's 'Filth' level will be reduced by one. At any time during the quiz, press CONTROL+ALT+X to bypass the questions and skip straight to the game. You will be prompted for a 'Filth' level; set it to '5' for maximum raunchiness.
<p>
<h2>I Wanna See Some Dancing Girls!</h2>
<p>
Early in the game, you will need to get into the floor show at the hotel/casino. Walk up to the gateman and type SHOW PASS. He will ask you for the pass number for a certain page; use this list to find it.
<p>
PAGE#   PASS#<br>
3-------00741<br>
5-------55811<br>
6-------30004<br>
9-------18608<br>
10------25695<br>
11------32841<br>
12------00993<br>
15------09170<br>
18------49114<br>
19------33794<br>
22------54482
<p>
After you give him the right number, the gateman will gesture with his hand. You will need to give him an additional item to actually get into the show.
<p>
WARNING: If you enter the wrong number, you will be killed in-game. Save before attempting!
<p>

<h2>Workin' Out</h2>
<p>
Later in the game, you will get into the Fat City spa with a 'borrowed' membership card. Type TURN OVER CARD to see the back, where there are 3 local business names written in order. Use the list below to find the corresponding page numbers for those business' ads. These three page numbers, in the same order as the names on the card, are the combination to your Fat City locker.

<h2>I Hate Mazes</h2>
<p>
After you switch characters, you will have to navigate a seemingly-endless maze of bamboo. Starting from the first maze screen, follow these directions to reach the exit:
<p>
North-North-East-East-North-West-North-East-North-North-North-West-West-South-West-West-North-North-West-North
<p>
North is towards the top of the screen, East is to the right, West is to the left, and South is towards the bottom. Look carefully; sometimes the paths you need are obscured by the bamboo.
<p>
As well as these directions, you will need an additional item to survive the maze. You need to find a way to carry water with you before you enter, or you will die of thirst before you reach the exit. Locate and fill such a container <b>before</b> you enter the maze. Once inside, you will get only <b>one</b> drink from the container before it is empty; you must wait for as long as possible before you use it. Wait until your character is literally on hands and knees, <b>then</b> drink the water.
<p>
You will not be able to return through the maze after you reach the other side, so make sure to take everything you might need from the resort area before you enter.
