I have assembled this information in (hopefully) easy-to-understand formats, and created a series of HTML indexes to allow quick, easy browsing of the material.

This is a slightly expanded version of the SCPC torrent.  Sahil Javeri found the copy protection posted at SierraGamers, and asked me to add it to SCPC since Cap'n Ascii has gone AWOL.


[b]Torrent contents and instructions[/b]
Zipped folder, as originally found, of 93 files/folders of images and html.  Make sure to read the "Read Me" file, especially the part that says, "MAKE SURE you enable the 'Use folder names' option!"
