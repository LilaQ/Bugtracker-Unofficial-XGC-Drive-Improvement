Once you have command of a ship, you will spend much time travelling between planets. To go to another planet, first command Droole (the red guy) to 'lay in a course'. He will ask for coordinates; look up your destination in the list below and enter the corresponding 5-digit code.
<p>
Commodore LXIV - 01015<br>
Galgularis - 71552<br>
Gingivitis - 81100<br>
Kiz Urazgubi - 20011<br>
Klorox II - 90210<br>
Lukazuk II - 91001<br>
Monostadt VII - 54671<br>
Peeyu - 92767<br>
The Spacebar - 69869<br>
Spittoonie - 44091<br>
Thrakus - 53284
<p>
There is one 'secret' destination whose coordinates have NOT been included in this list. This location, as well as the coordinates to get there, can be found in-game as part of a puzzle; they will not be duplicated here.

Gir Draxon was right...this CP scheme <b>is</b> rather buttheaded. :)
