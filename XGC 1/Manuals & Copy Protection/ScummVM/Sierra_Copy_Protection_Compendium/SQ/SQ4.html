<h2>"Appropriating" the Time Pod</h2>
<p>
Early in the game, you will need to "borrow" a time machine. When you enter the vehicle, you will be presented with a pair of symbols. Look up the symbols <a href="SQ4.png">here</a> and enter the letter coordinates that represent them on the grid using the provided keypad (column first, row second).
<p>
WARNING: Repeated failure to pass this CP check will result in an in-game death. Save before attempting.
<p>
Despite appearences, the actual code-based operation of the time machines does NOT constitute a CP check. You can find all the codes you need in the game itself. Be sure to write down any codes you see, as you will not be able to backtrack without them.
