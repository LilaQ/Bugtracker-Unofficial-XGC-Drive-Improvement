<h2>Flower Power</h2>
<p>
During the sequence of events at Ot Moor, you will be tested on your knowledge of "the language of the flowers" by having to answer several riddles. Look <a href="CQ1-A.txt">here</a> to learn what each flower represents, then use the info when answering the riddles.
<p>
Additionally, the Message of the Rose can come in very handy for crossing the Moor (lake) itself, assuming you have the right item...
<p>
<h2>Holy Crap</h2>
<p>
At two later points in the game, you'll once again be faced with riddles that demand knowledge from the game manual, this time of the various Goddesses. <a href="CQ1-B.txt">Here</a> is (almost) all of the information you need.
<p>
Notice I said "ALMOST all". In addition to the manual, you'll need to learn the symbols of the goddesses. This information can be discovered in the game itself; be sure to ask about it to the right people.
<p>

<p>

<p>
HAM AND JAM AND SPAM A LOT
