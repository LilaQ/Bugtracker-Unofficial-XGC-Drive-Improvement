<h2>Medic!</h2>
<p>
Now here's an original CP scheme. :)
<p>
Very early in the game, you'll encounter a situation at the beach, where a woman begins drowning. After swimming out to her rescue, you'll need to perform CPR to save her life (the instructions for which are, of course, in the game manual).
<p>
After you've gotten the poor girl back to dry land, follow these directions EXACTLY.
<p>
1) SHAKE AND SHOUT<br>
2) CALL FOR HELP<br>
3) ESTABLISH AIRWAY<br>
4) LOOK, LISTEN, AND FEEL<br>
5) GIVE TWO GOOD BREATHS<br>
6) LOOK, LISTEN, AND FEEL<br>
7) CHECK PULSE<br>
8) BEGIN COMPRESSION<br>
9) CHECK PULSE
<p>
Assuming you did it right, she'll be fine. All in a day's work, for a Navyman, eh?
<p>

<h2>A Cure for the Common Code</h2>
<p>
Partway through the U.S.S. Blackhawk's journey, you'll be sent an encrypted radio message; your job is to decipher it.
<p>
The first step is to make note of the numbers relayed to you by the radioman (WRITE THEM DOWN!). Each set consists of of letters seperated by dashes, like this:
<p>
<b>Example</b>
<br>A-B-C
<br>or
<br>AA-B-C
<p>
The next step is to translate the letters into numbers. The code key required to do this can be found somewhere on the ship.
<p>
Once that's finished, you'll be left with sets of numbers like these:
<p>
<b>Example</b>
<br>7-1-4
<br>14-3-2
<p>
Now comes the copy protection part. These numbers are references to specific keywords in the game manual. The idea is to use the numbers to find the decryptor keys hidden on certain pages, copies of which you can find <a href="CI.txt">here</a>.
<p>
The first number of each set indicates the page number of the manual; the second denotes the line number; the third denotes the word number.
<p>
Let's walk through an example...we'll use the numbers 14-3-2 from above. Look up Page 14, Line 3, Word 2 in the list to find the keyword, in this case "SIGNAL". See, it's easy!
<p>
Once you have the keywords, enter them into the decryptor computer in your cabin to read the secret message.
