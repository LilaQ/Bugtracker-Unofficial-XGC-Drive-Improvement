Throughout the game, you will have to use Freddy's backroom lab table to create the the various medicines you'll need to complete the game. Although at first you'll only be filling prescriptions, later game puzzles will require more direct application of Freddy's pharmacological knowledge.
<p>
The original FPFP manual took the form of a (fake) medical handbook, containing all of the formulas needed in the game itself. These formulas have been reproduced below.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Tyloxpolynide (Penelope's Prescription)</h3>
The <b>Tyloxpolynide</b> is sitting in ready-to-use form on the lab shelf...or rather, the empty bottle is. You'll need to substitute using <b>Pepticlymacine Tetrazole</b>. Measure out 40ml, pour into a medicine bottle, and cork it.
<p>
<h3>Quinotrazate (Helen's Prescription)</h3>
To create <b>Quinotrazate</b>, measure out 15ml of <b>Bismuth Enterosalicyline</b> and 30gm of <b>Phenodol Oxytriglychlorate</b>. Combine these in the glass beaker and stir with a glass stirring rod. Now, process the medicine into pill form by pouring it into the pill-making machine. Take an empty medicine bottle and use it repeatedly on the pill machine to fill it. Once all 21 pills are in the bottle, cork it.
<p>
<h3> Estrosterane (Sadie's Prescription)</h3>
Now, this is where things get tricky. The first problem is that you can't read the prescription, which means you can't make the medicine. There's a item that will help you make out the handwriting; you'll find it in the saloon.
<p>
Once that's done, you'll notice that the prescription is for <b>Testosterate</b>, a medicine for promoting masculinity in males. Does that sound like something a <i>woman</i> needs? Heck no! Looks like the Doc has been writing prescriptions while drunk again...
<p>
Go show the prescription to Doc (he's in the saloon). He'll fix the error. Now you know that you should be making <b>Estrosterane</b>, a contraceptive.
<p>
Back at the lab, measure out 15gm of <b>Bimethylquinoline</b> and pour it into the mortar. Next, measure out 15 gm of <b>Metyraphosphate</b> and pour that into the mortar as well. Use the mortar to grind the mixture.
<p>
Now, take 6 medicine papers down from the shelf and spread them out on the table. Put an empty prescription box on the table as well. Using the 5gm measuring spoon, scoop up the mixture in the mortar and dole it out onto the papers. Once all 6 papers are full, place them in the box.
<p>
<h3>Preperation G (Smithy's Prescription)</h3>
This one's so easy, I shouldn't even help you with it. You don't even have to mix this one up...the Preperation G is lying in plain sight on the left-hand countertop in the pharmacy. Just get the tube and give it to him.
<p>
<h3>Aminophyllic Citrate (Horse Gas)</h3>
When the horses of Coarsegold start stinking up the town, you'll need to create a medicine to cure them. Before you can do so, however, you must first figure out the cause of their illness.
<p>
Once you've found a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the fumes, you must obtain a sample of horse gas. Find an appropriate container, then use it on a horse (any one will do) to obtain the sample.
<p>
Back in the lab, you'll need to use the alcohol lamp and spectroscope (if the lamp won't light, you'll need to refill it with alcohol). Light the lamp, put the scope in front of it, then use the gas sample on the scope to burn it and get a reading.
<p>
Now that you've done that, you can start mixing the <b>Aminophyllic Citrate</b> you need. Measure out 40gm of <b>Sodium Carbonate</b> and 15ml of <b>Furachlordone</b>, and combine them in the glass beaker. Next, measure out 45ml of <b>Water</b> and add it to the beaker as well (this should bring the beaker contents up to 100ml). Measure out 5 grams of Magnesium Sulfate and add it to the beaker, then stir with a glass stirring rod. Pour the mixture into an empty bottle and cork it.
<p>
<h3>Bisalicylate Antitoxidene (Diarrhea)</h3>
As if the horse gas wasn't disgusting enough, now you have this to deal with. Wonderful.
<p>
To create the <b>Bisalicylate Antitoxidene</b> that will cure the townsfolk, measure out 25ml of <b>Bismuth Subsalicylate</b> and 5ml of <b>Orphenamethihydride</b>, and combine them in the <i>test tube</i> (not the beaker). Light the alcohol lamp, and hold the test tube over the flame to boil the mixture. Once that's done, pour it into an empty bottle and cork it. Dilute with approximately 1,000 gallons of water before administering.
