<h2>Romancing the Stones</h2>
<p>
On Day 5 (or Day 6, depending on how you do things), you'll need to sneak inside the Fens monastary in disguise. To "prove" your identity to the monestary boatman, you'll need to answer his 'gem riddles'.
<p>
The monk will ask you a question. Look it up <a href="CQ2-A.png">here</a>, and give him the three gemstones that make up the correct response.
<h2>Giving the Finger(s)</h2>
<p>
On Day 7 (and later on in the game), you'll encounter puzzles requiring you to communicate using a special Druidic code. The code key can be found <a href="CQ2-B.png">here</a>. Remember, to 'enter' your message, click on the center of the palm.
<p>
The Druidic plant names provided will be needed for later puzzles involving the hand code.
<p>
<h2>Up In Arms</h2>
<p>
On Day 8, you'll be asked to select a Coat of Arms (emblem) to match information given to you earlier. Look <a href="CQ2-C.png">here</a> for the Coats of Arms and the groups they represent.
